He is known for his gray hair and sound advice and is often referred to as "my dad". He hopes to do his best motivating chairs to set and attain beneficial goals for the chapter this next year and finally find that sweater he lost at the chapter house last year.</p>

        <p> Currently a 5th year mechanical engineering student. Interests include prototype vehicle club, cooking, football, hanging out with friends, video games, movies and snowboarding.  I wanted to be Sentinel because I believe in the importance of our rituals and traditions, and want to maintain that for future Phi Sigs. An interesting fact is that I have an uncle named John Lennon.... Just not The John Lennon. </p>

          <h4>Kyle Crooks</h4> <h5>Rush Chair</h5>
          <p> My name is Kyle Crooks and I am a 3rd year Industrial Engineering major. I recently spent part of my summer studying at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China learning about quality engineering. Hangzhou is located about a few hours south of Shanghai. After my trip to China and learning about their health care industry, I realized my passion for biomedical devices and hope to pursue a career in medical device manufacturing. I joined Phi Sigma Kappa because I believe it defies the typical stereotype Fraternities get and is a chapter of genuine men. I have since met some of my closest friends in this chapter. I ran for rush chair because I hope to recruit men who will make Phi Sig a better place and I want to give these men an opportunity to meet the same life long friends that I have.</p>

          <h4>Joe Shutz</h4> <h5>Social Chair</h5>
          <p>I live a pretty classic college life – juggling school, friends, fraternity, my dog, my girlfriend and a hand full of things to keep me alive (like eating). The places I frequent during the school year are the broadcasting studio, the library, every sports facility as I am a sports reporter for Mustang News, the fraternity house and finally my bed. With all of this on my plate I hardly have time to get out and enjoy myself. That’s why I take every opportunity I can get to go out into nature. I am an avid camper/nature enthusiast and my bucket-list includes every state park in California. My hometown is Sacramento California the City of Trees. I have recently been interning at KCRA-3 the local news station and have learned a lot about the community I live in (the good and the bad).</p>
